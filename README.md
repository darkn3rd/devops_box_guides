# **DevOps Boxen Guides**

These are small guides for setting up a local development environment for Dev/Test/Ops on Lin/Win/Mac.  

This will have three general conceptual areas for any system:

* Virtual/Container Environments including Docker
* Command Lines Tools and Language Platforms
* Graphical Tools like Editors, IDEs, and fun stuff (Spotify, Slack)


## **Environemnts**

For now only targeting:

* Mac OS X:
  * Mac OS 10.12 Sierra with Homebrew
* Windows 10
   * Windows 7, 8.1, 10 with Virtualbox + MYS2
* Linux:
   * Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus


## **Notes**

### **Future**

At some point in the future, interested in documenting:

* **Linux**
  * Distros: CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Arch
  * Virtualization: libvrt
* **Windows**
  * Versions: Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 2012, Windows 2016
  * Virtualization: Hyper/V path
  * Shell: CygWin, Windows Subsystem for Linux  
* **Mac OS X**
  * Versions: Mavericks to latest (High Sierra 10.13)
  * Package Managers: MacPorts

### **Challenges**

The Linux versions are easy as everything is open source.  For Windows, Microsoft has evaluations available for testing with downloadable Vagrant boxes.

The Mac OS X poses a challenge, as it is not easily virtualizable. Earlier versions used to work, but now crash, and changes in Sierra make it near impossible to use custom scripts as startup.  For High Sierra, the process has changed, and with addition of new file system, things become more challenging.
